  Onegini Application Thumbprint Android
summary: |
  Calculates the application's thumbprint used by the Onegini Mobile SDK
description: |
  The step is dedicated for Onegini Mobile Security Platform users, who use the Onegini Mobile SDK iOS in their Android apps.

  The step calculates the application's thumbprint that is necessary to properly setup a mobile app project. The calculated
  value is returned in the ONEGINI_APP_THUMBPRINT so that it can be used by the developers using separate steps.

  The step requires you to have the access to the Onegini's Artifactory repository where Onegini SDKs and application
  thumbprint calculators can be found. Because of that the step requires you to provide a proper Artifactory credentials
  (username and password) as inputs.

  For iOS apps please find a dedicated "Onegini Application Thumbprint iOS" step.
